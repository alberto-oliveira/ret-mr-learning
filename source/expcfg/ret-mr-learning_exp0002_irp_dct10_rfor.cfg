# Experiment configuration file. Default section has the name of the experiment
# and topk considered. Sections named featX, where X is a number, define feature_key
# extractors to be used, which have a name, and parameters reflecting those used in
# each extraction function. If an 'IRP' section is present, it defines
# the experiment as individual relevance prediction, and configures the classifier 
# to do so. Performance prediction will be done through predicted relevances.
# Otherwise, if a RPP section is present, defines the experiment
# as rank relevance prediction, and performs performance prediction through
# classification.
